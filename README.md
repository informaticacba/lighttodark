## Getting Started

To build the dark mode without any error, you need to follow the following guidelines.

**Step 1:**

Create a new document

**Step 2:** 

Create a page named "**`Light`**" (case sensitive). 

All the screens from the page **`Light`** will be ****generated to dark mode.

**Step 3:** 

Create the shared style for both **`light`** and **`dark`** (note: shared style naming must be prefixed with **`dark/{your style}`** or **`light/{your style}`**). Check the example for shared style naming

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **The** s**hared style should need to follow below**

Light:
`light/primary/border`

Dark:
`dark/primary/border`

If you are creating a style for the light you also need to define dark mode otherwise it will throw an error:
`light/{ YOUR - STYLE - GOES - HERE }
 dark/{ YOUR - STYLE - GOES - HERE }`

</aside>

**Step 4:**

Apply every layer with the shared style. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ On the page Light, you need to apply the style for the `light/{YOUR STYLE}` otherwise it will throw an error.

</aside>

**Step 5:** 

Run `Plugins > Light to Dark ðŸŒ“ > Convert to Dark mode`   or 

simply press `ctrl + shift + c`

## Using Boilerplate
