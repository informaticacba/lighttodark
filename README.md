## How does it help you?

1. Create a dark mode in a single tap
2. You will get the organised shared styles for both Light and Dark mode
3. Easy to use and lightweight
4. We also help you to set up the project by **Boilerplate** option



## Getting Started

To build the dark mode without any error, you need to follow the following guidelines.

**Step 1:**

Create a new document

**Step 2:** 

Create a page named "`Light`" (case sensitive). 

All the screens from the page `Light` will be generated to dark mode.

**Step 3:** 

Create the shared style for both `light` and `dark` (note: shared style naming must be prefixed with `dark/{your style}` or `light/{your style}` ). Check the example for shared style naming


**Step 4:**

Apply every layer with the shared style. 



**Step 5:** 

Run `Plugins > Light to Dark ðŸŒ“ > Convert to Dark mode`   or 

simply press `ctrl + shift + c`

## Using Boilerplate

We made your work simpler by using boilerplate

1. We will create a page with the name **Light**
2. We will also create a few shared styles for both light and dark modes. You can customise any time
